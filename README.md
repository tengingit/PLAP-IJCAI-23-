Possible commands: **conda install numpy** and **conda install scikit-learn**.

- Run all cells above **'Test'** for function definition.
- Run the first cell below **'Test'** for load data sets. Feel free to change data sets.
- Run the last cell for hamming score, exact match and sub-exact match obtained by **PLAP** method in *Song* data set with default parameter setting.

***
Jupyter notebook is recommended for running this file in '.ipynb' format.

Feel free to convert it into python file in '.py' format.
